This is a fork of Eric Melton's Open Source Self Check software. It is designed to run on WAMP, but should work on any webserver platform that allows PHP and sockets. This fork contains several changes made to fix compatability issues with Evergreen Indiana's SIP2 system and also adds SSL compatibility for webmail SMTP servers. Unless you are an Evergreen Indiana library, or experiencing compatibility issues that this software is designed to fix, I highly recommend using Eric's software instead: https://code.google.com/p/open-source-self-check/ 99.9% of the code was written or assembled by him.

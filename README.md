This is a fork of Eric Melton's Open Source Self Check software specifically tailored to work with Evergreen Indiana libraries who are looking to build a fully customizable, low cost self-checkout solution. It is designed to run on WAMP, but should work on any webserver platform that allows PHP and sockets. This fork contains changes made to fix compatability issues with Evergreen Indiana's SIP2 system and also adds SSL compatibility for webmail SMTP servers. Unless you are an Evergreen Indiana library, or experiencing compatibility issues that this software is designed to fix, I highly recommend using Eric's software instead: https://code.google.com/p/open-source-self-check/ 99.9% of the code was written or assembled by him.
